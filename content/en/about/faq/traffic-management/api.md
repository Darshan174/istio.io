Any version will give you the most up-to-date functionality and it doesn't really matter which version is used. There is no reason to use a specific version (unless you are an integration author, then checkout this [link](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/)), and hence there no need to spend time migrating existing resources or anything like that.
